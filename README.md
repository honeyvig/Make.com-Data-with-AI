# Make.com-Data-with-AI
Setting up a Make.com scenario to process 10,000 rows of data with AI involves creating a workflow that integrates various modules to handle your data and prompts efficiently. Below is a basic Python code structure that can be adapted for use in a Make.com scenario. This code outlines a 5-step process where AI prompts are utilized to process the data.
Python Code for Data Processing Scenario

python

import pandas as pd
import openai

# Initialize OpenAI with your API key
openai.api_key = 'your_api_key_here'

def ask_ai(prompt, data):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt.format(data=data)}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message['content']

def process_data(file_path):
    # Load the data from a CSV file
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

    # Step 1: Initial data inspection
    initial_prompt = "Inspect the following data and provide a summary: {data}"
    initial_summary = ask_ai(initial_prompt, data.head().to_string())
    print("Initial Summary:", initial_summary)

    # Step 2: Qualifying questions about column 1
    column_1_prompt = "Based on the following data in Column 1, what are the key insights? {data}"
    column_1_insights = ask_ai(column_1_prompt, data['Column1'].to_string())
    print("Column 1 Insights:", column_1_insights)

    # Step 3: Qualifying questions about column 2
    column_2_prompt = "What trends can you identify in Column 2? {data}"
    column_2_trends = ask_ai(column_2_prompt, data['Column2'].to_string())
    print("Column 2 Trends:", column_2_trends)

    # Step 4: Qualifying questions about column 3
    column_3_prompt = "Analyze Column 3 for anomalies or significant data points: {data}"
    column_3_analysis = ask_ai(column_3_prompt, data['Column3'].to_string())
    print("Column 3 Analysis:", column_3_analysis)

    # Step 5: Final recommendations
    final_prompt = "Given the insights from the above analyses, what are your recommendations for this data? {data}"
    final_recommendations = ask_ai(final_prompt, data.to_string())
    print("Final Recommendations:", final_recommendations)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    process_data('path_to_your_data_file.csv')

Explanation of the Code

    OpenAI Integration: The code uses the OpenAI API to generate responses based on prompts you provide.

    Data Loading: The data is loaded from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. You can adjust this to match your data source.

    5-Step Process:
        Step 1: Summarizes the data.
        Step 2: Asks for insights about a specific column.
        Step 3: Analyzes trends in another column.
        Step 4: Looks for anomalies in a third column.
        Step 5: Generates final recommendations based on the overall analysis.

Next Steps

    Modify Prompts: Customize the AI prompts according to your specific needs and the context of your data.
    Integrate with Make.com: Use this code as part of a larger automation scenario in Make.com. You can set up HTTP modules to call this script or run it in a cloud function.
    Batch Processing: If processing 10,000 rows at once is too much, consider batching the data for analysis.

Note

Before implementing, ensure you have the correct permissions and compliance with data privacy regulations when processing data, especially if it includes sensitive information.
